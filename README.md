# FDS-PROJECT


E-commerce platforms generate vast amounts of data daily, yet many businesses struggle to extract meaningful insights from it. This inability to leverage data effectively hinders crucial aspects such as sales optimization, targeted marketing, and customer experience enhancement, ultimately affecting growth and operational efficiency. Without data-driven decision-making, businesses miss opportunities to maximize revenue, personalize customer interactions, and optimize inventory management. This project aims to bridge this gap by applying data science techniques to analyse sales trends, segment customers, and build predictive models for improved marketing strategies and customer retention. By leveraging machine learning and data analytics, businesses can gain actionable insights, enhance customer engagement, and improve overall efficiency. The project will also develop visualization tools to help stakeholders interpret complex data easily, facilitating better strategic decisions. The ultimate goal is to transform raw e-commerce data into valuable intelligence that drives growth, increases profitability, and ensures a competitive edge in the digital marketplace .
